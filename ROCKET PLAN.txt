ROCKET PLAN

AIMS: reduce guarding, reduce fear/frustration reactions, able to socially play nice, solid recall, solid leave it

COMMANDS (in order): name, touch, find, give, leave, come

FOR EACH COMMAND (~20x each step)
    1. CT each time complete behavior performed.
    2. Add cue word; wait for behavior. Don't lure with treat. CT each time.
    3. Reward only best/quickest responses, ~1/2.
    4. Change the environment (flooring, my position, garage, dog run, etc) and back to step 1
    5. Vary the distractions (do at playfield periphery, back to step 1)
        May require high value treats!

PROGRESS METER
    Name (immediately break focus and look at me): Step 1
        Next:

    Touch (ignore distraction [break stare], come to me): Step 5
        Next:

    Find (sniff in area for treats / toy): Step 1
        Next:

    Give (drop whatever, wait for me): Step 1
        Next: with ball, click when dropped. Grab ball, Treat, Return/throw ball.

    Leave (ignore distraction [break stare], look at me): Step 1
        Next:
            1. Have normal and high value treats
            2. Hold high value treat in front of dog, but don't give
            3. Once dog stops trying to get high value treat, mark, and give normal treat
            4. Expand to having high value treat hand open
            5. Don't treat with high value treat!
            6. Start using the leave it command only when the dog is leaving the food alone by himself

    Come (unquestioningly, aside from prey drive): Step 1
        Next:

BEHAVIOR: reduce fear/frustration reactions; greet & play socially
    - Utilize long leash

    - (Mark & Move) Upon distraction, halt; keep leash loose, give cue (leave, touch) & try to distract away. MARK on disengagement, THEN move, THEN treat.
        Progress:

    - Don't reward bad behavior.

    - Just drag away if he tips past threshold
    - CT on good introductions; timeout on bad behavior

SET UPS
    - Edge of Green Lake: work on leave it (to not pull or pay attention to water), touch (similarly to break focus)

    - Edge of Playfield:

        If an off-leash dog runs at Rocket:
            - Stay calm. Try to lead Rocket away calmly (lure him with treats)
            - Get between dogs. Command other dog to sit; breaking its attention on Rocket

    - Around Robert:

    - Around Tonks:
