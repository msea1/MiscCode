## Fri 18 May

**Departure**: _08:29:44 PDT_ _Cloudy 12°C_
Robert says I'm usually at my most manic the morning of a trip. I'm not so sure. I certainly don't feel that way today. This is a long trip, with quite a few logisitical hurdles involved. I keep thinking about all the stuff to do throughout the trip. It seems so daunting!

But of course it does, it's 20 days long. If there wasn't a lot to do then it would be boring. To be better "in the moment" I need to be better able to tune out the future to some extent and just look at what's in front of me. Today is easy! It's just flying.

I always, always forget how much can get done in a full day devoted to travel.

Fittingly it begins raining as we depart Seattle; the first rain in quite awhile.

**Un-fucking-real**: _09:41:49 PDT_ _Cloudy 12°C_
SeaTac has up five security checkpoints available. Rarely are they all open. This morning there are four open, but general boarding is only allowed at one! And obviously it's swamped.

I wasted time bypassing that one originally because I was told there were others open, only to walk past all of them and told no. I'm furious.

Fuck capitalism.

I forgot to consider and bring the car seat pillow. Good for plane. Good as extra head pillow in hostel. Great for maxitaxis. Oh well 😕.

Airport food is so often a huge upsale. I took a little pride in finding this makeshift solution that was both not super marked up, nor unhealthy.

That said, I didn't really have a need for this. I wasn't hungry. And was going to be boarding a 9-hour flight to Istanbul in which they'd feed us twice. But it was a 4:20 layover (nice) here in Logan and, ultimately, I was just bored.

The plan for the month expires tomorrow. So a la 2015, I just disabled autopay. And set it to resume on the 5th. So that's 19 days without a useless service plan, saving me $20!

**Not able to check in online...**: _23:23:41 EDT_ _Mostly Clear 7°C_

![4a8fca440170510517adbdf9c2a660ce][3]

I was able to select my seats ahead of time for the four legs on Turkish Air. However, we couldn't formally check-in to the flight to Istanbul beforehand for, I assume, some visa or international reasons. And there's no gate attendant in Logan this far advance, so we go wander to kill time and find beer.

We dawdle a bit too much given that we aren't checked in. But arriving back at the game and getting our passes, we've been downgraded (why?) from row 13 to 23. That's some 60 odd people who now deplane before us, with a one hour connection to make.

And we had to stand in yet another unmoving queue to finally get our boarding passes, all the while making cracks about our last trip to Istanbul.

And I still don't have my milage account tied to it.

And my damn USB port doesn't work. Fucking again. JFC

And I didn't get my pre-ordered meal.

Did snag a decent pillow from the flight and a backup blanket. I'll use the pillow as a substitute for the car seat pillow, but even better because this is disposable as far as I'm concerned.

And it looks like we'll be about 20 minutes early so not real worried about the connection.

**Free mezes or...?**: _01:22:12 +04_ _Clear 17°C_

![43330386840336abc5d6cf7878ed26ce][10]

I hate the awkwardness of not knowing what's free and what might be an exorbitant ripoff in different cultures

I guess finding out is the basis for a funny story though either way?

39m for the food holy fucking hell. A kebab is like 3. Hate feeling taken advantage of, or being a rube. Also hate paying $25 for some chips, smoked cheese, and lemon slices with sugar. Even an airport would be ashamed to charge that.

Can't shake the anger. 39m would buy a good steak dinner for two! But also ultimately it's $20. God I'm broken.

Trying to look at it like a counseling lesson. Maybe now I won't feel awkward about being straight forward and asking "what is this?" and "how much does it cost?"

But so far three incidents in like 6 hours:
- No Bus, Taxi drivers
- Hostel putting us in 12-person dorm despite paying for 6-person
- The above

**Old Town dead**: _09:58:51 +04_
Nobody out. Not very exciting. Kinda hot in the sun all the time.


---

**"free" funicular**: _11:08:10 +04_
Charged 1 manat. The low level scam like that I don't much mind.

Also charged 1 manat for a water. No way


---

**Loooooong siesta**: _20:52:52 +04_
Went back to the hostel around 1p meaning to escape the sun and think of what to do.

Used a decent chunk of time interacting on tinder. A couple prostitutes. Weirdly the rate seems to be for two hours. Ranges from 100 to 150

Anyways, ended up falling asleep and instead of a cat nap, everytime ibwokenup there was no motivation to do anything so went back to sleep. Stayed in bed until 8:30! Not going to be great for getting on a normal schedule but oh well.

Larger picture I'm just not very excited by Baku. Can't quite tell why. Even in places not my fancy I usually get an energy boost from arriving. Instead I'm more wondering if I'll feel so nonplussed all trip. Maybe I'm just put off by the disappointing hostel and bulvar rip-off?

**Waiting for Robert and thinking**: _22:12:14 +04_

![458500a569bed537592170e46a7ea8d5][12]

The funicular going up had doors closed and locked despite running time until 10p it said (it was 9:30 at the time). I opted for the stairs and Robert true to form decided to wait and see.

Result is that I've been up here by the Soviet statue for 20 minutes. But it's nice. There's a persistent gentle breeze and the square is rather deserted leaving me unbothered and free to reflect. Robert comes along sooner than expected too.

I travel and avoid social interactions almost to a fault. No taxis or haggling or trying to learn from locals, preferring to do research ahead of time. I say it's to not look foolish and be taken advantage of.

(or be vulnerable? though when I've been truly vulnerable people have been amazing)

I travel to see human creations but don't like humans or want to interact with them?

I don't have the hesitation in Germany that I do here about trusting strangers. Is it culture? Is it language? Is it personal experience?

Just browsing around looking at what's there and what beers they have when a clerk comes over and complains about something and mimes. I keep saying I don't know and just decide to leave. On way out second clerk with a bit of English mildly interrogates us. Best I can tell accusing us of taking photos? Never even had phone out of my pocket.

Wait nevermind. Sheepish. Because i did take this.Thinking it was funny but Robert points out might be counterfeit

**Positive food step?**: _02:19:20 +04_
Deposite not really eating today and passing an abundance of late night döner stands for 3.5m, I didn't get one. Probably because of the bulvar thing but I can pretend it's because I'm not hungry and rationally decided not to eat just for the sake of eating cheaply.

Should get a döner tomorrow though


---

**Baku metro, to Sheki**: _09:57:37 +04_
Almost take an Uber to bus station but decide on metro instead. Get to see how deep it runs, for bomb shelter purposes.

Trying to decide on bus vs maxitaxi. Bus looks old probably not aircon and the guide says buses take less interesting route. So opt for typical maxitaxi can, 7m that leaves 50 minutes later. Supposedly.


---

**Messed up with Sheki lodging**: _12:08:35 +04_

![e422316758c0083f82ebb1167be443c9][17]

The hostel is quite a bit away from the sights to see. Best case this maxitaxi does only take four ish hours and we're there by 3pm, allowing leisurely walk to fortress


---

**Road to Sheki**: _13:45:38 +04_
Cows on the road.

Green rolling hills and arbor

Damn old woman came in and shut the window ahead of us, making the back stifling.

Split up because I'm willing to walk to Hostel and Robert isn't. Too late from him and the few ATMs in the center I remember I have no money

**Doing it cheap**: _16:29:44 +04_

![6a76b180b0c6d213db19999801c53416][18]

A taxi would be $1 while the bus (+connection) is $0.25 and I know I should "indulge" in convenience more but part of me feels cheated not doing as locals would. It's a bizarre fetish

You're like a two street town. How is there confusion on how to get to a place on one of the main drags?Has to ask three people for directions when literally it was drive down main street until other main street and take a right


## Tue 22 May

**Kish Albanian Church**: _06:46:47 +04_ _Mostly Cloudy 19°C_
Opens at 9 am. About 45-60 minute walk, or 10 minute taxi, or ? minute bus, away and if I were on my own I'd likely check out, walk there, then taxi to his station trying to catch the 10am maxi to Qax.

Actually that's not a good idea even as I hypothetically create it. Too little room for error in getting that maxi and the alternative isn't great after that.

Going to see Kish and the exterior doesn't seem worth it. The interior museum and artifacts do.

I probably would've done it yesterday by going maxi to palace to hostel, rest, then church. But couldn't because Robert.

Hard to accept not doing things even if they're likely somewhat marginal. As soon as I can't do it I start attaching all this mythos and prestige to it. I envision being able to tell a story about it and feel moved by it. Far more likely I won't and wouldn't.

**The habit of always pushing time**: _07:47:51 +04_
Leaves at 8 acted on like we can show up at 8 or little later

We need to pick up the pace a little and no change or even acknowledgement

Aaron is me except at all times while I try to only be like it when pressing against a deadline. But my trips usually feature a lot of deadlines since I pack them so tight. Which works for me solo.

(Also wouldn't be so tight in this case if it wasn't always 10-15 minutes from ok let's go to actually going) and I hate feeling like I have to be the schedule master at all times. Like pulling teeth multiple times a day. Puts me in a foul mood

Rarely any outward enthusiasm. Hard for me to get positive by relation

The fatness causing a burden on others due to exertion level, energy, and also has to have best seats


---

**Qax**: _08:05:15 +04_
Watched the minibus pass us (empty) on walk to bus station, then it's not there when we arrive at 8:02

Go via zaqatala or balakan? Or taxi to Qax (15, down to 12, probably get down to 10).

Only 26 manat left between us makes the connection to Tbilisi a little worrisome?

Robert's not wrong about bartering here is a little gross. But I'm not wrong about not taking first offers on principle.

Also irritates me that he'd be so blithe "let's just get a taxi". I know it's not actually that much money, (see also remarking on beer costs of 4.5m) it's the relative inflation I'm just noting. Taxi is 6x more expensive and we didn't catch the maxi because of you.

For me, continue fighting notion of trying to save pennies at every opportunity. Remember Bend? It was a little anxious to be so careless but not bad. Remember that the point isn't to save it's to experience. If frugality becomes it's own goal then you've lost.

Hard for me to walk that line. Noting also that just an hour ago we were making fun of Kirk for his lack of money sense and just spending without thinking

Robert notes the car keeps dying mid drive

Roads are surprisingly nice after the horror show in Sheki

Aaaaaaand bus leaves at 10:30 not 9:30. So we have some time to kill

---

**Ilisu Qax mini Swiss**: _09:28:43 +04_
Good idea. My inherent conservative kicks in and veto. But remember to appreciate the idea

Later rationalize that relying on last bus to Tbilisi not great idea. Though could always just taxi again


---

**To Tbilisi**: _11:59:38 +04_
Qax has a cool old town but it is Leavenworth like I'm being somewhat artificial. Though not completely foreign like Leavenworth.

The maxis keep shuffling people to avoid having unaccompanied women sit next to men


---

**Azeri to Georgia border**: _12:58:57 +04_
Had a poster board in four languages, including English, about claiming refugee status. Who is that aimed at?

To Tbilisi

Took six hours total. I was right. Maybe it was four hours from the border.

**Gori and beyond**: _08:31:09 +04_ _Mostly Sunny 21°C_
So hard and frustrating to have daily planning discussion because Robert never remembers any details even from conversations a few hours ago. Have to constantly backtrack and explain timing and logistics. So his suggestion are rarely helpful and it just wastes time. And frustrates me because how are you this forgetful?

So stop having them? Travel like you would on your own. You wouldn't have this discussion with yourself.

Always taking up two seats on metro too. Just selfish and unconcerned about others by default

**Rare case of being approached by girls and not a scam?**: _10:39:09 +04_
Two girls approach is at bus station first speaking Russian I think then English. Saying their going to Gori but just two girls and don't want to get scammed. They ask to travel together.

Seems super fishy especially since one is very very attractive and wearing upscale clothes not at all fit for maxitaxi travel.

But as we walk towards maxis they don't try to steer us to anything or engage in conversation. Seems actually genuine. They follow us to the van and also get in and also pay.


---

**Pass a road sign saying Istanbul 1715**: _11:12:38 +04_
That's over a 1,000 miles away. Like getting on I5s and seeing San Francisco and not Portland. Which we should absolutely do.

Also pass signs for sokhumi.

Always amused by the dropping off of maxi passengers in the middle of nowhere.

Pass the scene of a construction truck that completely burned down.

Remember to incorporate counseling and other keep notes into this after the fact

**Stalin M**: _12:40:41 +04_
Use UW id to net free train admission :)

How does a revolution actually happen? The nuts and bolts. Thinking about enders game and the net vs reality XKCD comic vs sometimes it does actually work (Soviets).

A hoped for cascadia rev allows me shook to understand. But have to think of something like Vietnam with the draft combined with a WW1 style homefront. So much I will never be able to grasp because we've never even come close to knowing what a home front is like

**Gori and Kutaisi**: _13:33:45 +04_
So far a day I worried about how transport would work is going fine and languid. Not feeling rushed and enjoying the day. Having to skip some slightly out of town stuff like mtskheta and up caves and kut monastery but successfully not fretting.

Welp, no transportation to Kutaisi (bus would've cost 20l [for 2]). But instead of paying 80l for taxi get maxi to Khassuri for 6l, leaving in 20 and then we'll see.

Think 60l would've been ok price from Gori. Khassuri is ~1/3 way there so if no maxi I'd consider 40l total for taxi rest of way a fair deal.

Taxi less than 5x the bus cost is generally ok in my book

1503 - maxi breaks down. 🧐

I'm very reliant on Latin script. Place names (ie bus placards) in non Latin confound me.

Ask for help spotting a van and Robert sits down facing away from the oncoming vans. Guarantee he's going to just say he doesn't think one is coming, (or that they all look uncomfortable) without offering an action. He's going to want a taxi but not do anything about it

Eventually after waiting 15 minutes to no avail we cross the street and find a taxi stand. Guy asks where we going and after a breif language barrier per usual we come to an understanding in Spanish! 20l to Kutaisi. A pretty good steal.

He asks for address. I forget taco comes with Dustin dog (taxi comes with custom drop off) who is nice because Kutaisi isn't super convenient station. It comes at price of 10l more but saves us like 5km.

Would kyle do this?

The stranger trust here compared to say Azerbaijan or even taxi in Seattle.

Taxi vs maxi cost benefit analysis. But I do wish Robert wouldn't be so damn preachy about it after the fact. If you have a reason to prefer a taxi bring it up beforehand! Defend your point!

There are good reasons for taxis that appeal to me. Speed and convenience of custom drop off. Fun driving. Potentially able to ask for photo stops.

It's a natural gas taxi.

Why does Georgia have both cars with left and right hand drive?

**Can't give homeless services**: _14:04:22 +04_
Because not all deserve it. A) they think 90% are grifters choosing to be homeless. But even if you get them to agree most aren't they'll fall back on the anecdotes of a few bad apples and say you can't justify helping them even if you'd mostly help good people.

But take that logic and apply it to collateral damage and civilian casualties and their argument is immediately 180. We have to bomb for the greater good even if there's collateral damage.

Never had a welcome to hostel like this. Just here's your room. No check in info (grabbed from the reservation) or payment or orientation.

Really feel uncomfortable with round-trip taxis because they wait on me at the sight.

Able to ignore feeling and enjoy it. Get a stop at Motsameta too.

Good convo with hostel runner and Tobias from Munich. Other German girls also going to Mestia are sleeved about splitting a taxi four ways for 50l instead of 25l.

Really struggling with the taxi v bus decision. Really want to just do the easy bus option whereas the progressive choice is probably taxi?

Also I'm getting disquieting vibes about abkhazia the closer it gets

Plan for Mestia is hike to chal glacier? Long hike for sure but maybe good for me. Not much to do in town anyways.

Will have to get going early tmrw morning for marsh to Zugdidi

If the girls would've joined us would've made taxi decision easy. Only extra 25l each plus saves 2, maybe 3 hours! Able to leave about 8:30 instead of 10:30 and drives faster. Plus maybe photo stops. Plus nicer ride.

But I can understand their hesitation. Two stranger guys, four to a taxi isn't always comfortable. And Robert tried to sell the taxis speed by mentioning the risky fast driving. Not how to sell it!

Petro prices here appear to be 2.45l which is $1. Per gallon? That's unusual. But per liter would mean very expensive

Intertia and following the girls wins out and it's maxi. Little sad about not having the wind and views and speed of a taxi but relieved at the price and somewhat comfort of other travelers.

But now watch this be very uncomfortable...

Not too bad actually. Tinted windows that don't open though.

Sure are a lot of Germans here

**Mestia**: _13:04:36 +04_
Goal is chalbaardi glacier hike. Ethno museum would be a plus if able to do that then taxi out to hike and walk back. Guessing 4+ hours RT for the hike. Want to be back by 8:30 so have to leave by 4 could be ok but kinda pushing it. With taxi, say leave by 6 or 5:30 to be safe (esp if w/Robert)

- Visa -- *discovered Morning Of Not Open Weekends, * turned out to work ok
- Return To Border -- getting a taxi to border proved weirdly hard but overall no problem. Didn't get to keep the visa :(
- Night Train -- *appears to be no problem* was no problem except stuffy
- Agdam -- skipped
- Leaving NK -- no problem

**Panic about abkhazia**: _07:30:33 +04_ _Sunny 28°C_
Rereading the guide to get a sense of the overview again I encounter that the MFA is open 9-5 m-f **only**

Best case I think is we're in sukhomi at 2:30, realistic case is 4...

And you have to pay for the visa at a bank and their hours are unknown...

Abkhazia is on Moscow time instead of Gerogia time so it's one hour behind, buying us another hour...

Why didn't we catch this in advance? Could've switched around to do abkhazia yesterday. I know I blanked, seeing NK visa office open 7 days a week.

But how come the myriad of personal blogs that detail getting to abkhazia never mention weekend issues?

I think we can pull this off and I think there's better odds than not we try but this is not a smart play I think. Downside is were stuck there untill getting a visa on Monday, meaning out on the two yours that I most wanted to do.

Meanwhile the alternative plan is realistically good, head to batumi.

And prior to the visa thing I was feeling very anxious about this section of the trip. I woke up at 3am and couldn't go back to sleep. Now I'm offered a lifeline to bail on it and all I feel is disappointment.

***
I hate feeling like I chicken out on something. Like I'm eternally comparing myself to some mythical (Australian) backpacker. That's dumb.

And that I'll feel like I let people down when I return having not lived up to my goals. They won't actually care. Also why should I?

Do I want to go to abkhazia for me? Or to be able to tell others? To have a one up card against other stories?

I do want to go for me, it seems interesting and cool. But have to acknowledge that others plays a big draw in it as well and it should not.

Isn't going to Georgia etc a good enough story? Goes back again to things going according to plan does not make for good (enough) stories.
***

I wonder if missing out on abkhazia because of a planning oversight would convince Robert to take planning more seriously. (Haha, no)

Batumi is the smart call. Sukhomi is the "good story" call. Being trapped is a funny story and missing the yours sucks but isn't a life breaker if I assume I'm coming back. And can do kakheti tour the last Monday before flying out, or a self Kazbegi tour.

**To Zugdidi**: _10:28:58 +04_
Have the backseat of the maxi to myself and a pile of bags so that's pretty nice

Get into Zugdidi with time. Confirm maxis to batumi available. Confirm night train available with tickets.

**Border**: _13:09:54 +04_

![61bc06ad2c1c7b03a94980631a114ca6][33]

Waiting at Georgian side for 30 minutes. See UN vehicles (2nd time ever, Kosovo) and cars with abkhazia plates13:30 arrive at Abkhazia border. Cleared first stop in 15.

Second one taking much longer. Putting time for visa at risk. Waited in front of two way mirror post for 20 minutes.

Then escorted across street, past a fence, past another fence and taken to a portable office where our passports are handed to a senior looking fellow. On the wall of the office is a nap and the other wall has a giant Russian flag with an eagle logo and Russia spelled out...

We're escorted back to our original spot and told to wait ten minutes. It takes fifty until a guy comes to question us. His insignia is three stars in a triangle with two more stars from the top.

He asks basic questions. How long, where, asks about previous trips (Ukraine). It takes maybe 5 minutes. Then he hands passports back and simply says
> welcome

I wonder how that process plays out if we're Canadian or if we had a Russian visa

The entire time I felt basically no reaction


---

**Abkhazia Visa**: _15:11:03 +04_
Through the border at 3pm Georgia time. Right at the fucking limit. Should be 2pm local time. We should get there with an hour to spare. But we've heard be there by 4 (our host), by 5 (MFA itself), by 6 (lonely planet).

I'm ready to go, completely and he says he is but he's not and then decides now is the time to investigate changing the rental car. Because that'll be quick... Meanwhile I'm now stuck waiting. You had so many hours earlier this morning to do this. Selfish. Never thinks ahead or to when to do things to minimize impact on others. It's a very ugly trait.

**A finish is not worth it**: _00:30:15 +04_
50l but no change for 60 and the stupidly paid 20 more for brief view of tits. Good tits though. I miss tits. But whats dumb is that a finish, after an hour of massage build up took like one minute. Very not worth the cost.

But it's not really related to traveling so I think note it here, 80l ($32) and keep it off budget. After all, remember to spend your money?

Really want to feel a snatch though and that doesn't seem like a thing here. Surprisingly little info online.

The massage is good though. Legit. And only 60l / hour

Task now is not to dwell on it and impact on trip budget

Should've done wine tour on last day of trip. Could've gone to Armenia one day sooner, returned one day sooner. Leaves last Sunday open for museum and also if we wanted to buy Georgian wine could buy it on tour and immediately bring it home. And made for a logistically relaxing final day.

We don't have much time in yerevan so trying to figure out if tour makes sense wrt. Cuts down on alaverdi later but also takes extra 6 hours to reach yerevan.

My urge is to discuss with Robert but what's the point? He can't keep simple details correct in his head and therefore rarely provides good insight. Best case is he gets me to think of an idea in a new way

As in for that Monday mtskheta, ramble, wine souvenir, sulphur baths

**Best and brightest thoughts**: _19:05:29 +04_
Keep being treated, thought of, analyzed as, a military war. But it was a political war. Body counts don't matter. Civilian morale does. And the SV govt was corrupt and out of touch :o

Military loyalty to itself rather than to the truth and trust in it's civilian oversight. Thinking it knows better. Do the civilians want us there? Eg Iraq

Catch-22: If you aren't considered loyal to your brothers you won't find the truth that you need to tell to others outside your brotherhood. And when dissent is punished then you only get failure.

Question the information's loyalty.

Sack people who are wrong.

Lost about two hours time figuring out the bus. Hopefully figuring out the bus... And then it literally drives right by our hostel. Should've asked hostel. Keep forgetting that.

Sickening thought that there are two airports. But wikivoyage definitely said Zvarnots...

Robert's routine of laying in bed for two hours then complaining about wasting time waiting for a bus and instead we should take a taxi is infuriating. Don't make me pay for your shit

And don't give me shit like I was laying in bed too. I was laying in bed, completely packed. I don't need to be your task master at all hours. Show your own fucking initiative.

Not fucking fair that I do all the planning then have to be tour guide and drill sergeant and pay extra for your high maintenance.

But getting upset at him doesn't do any good. He'll never ever change or realize or acknowledge it. So why bother. If he says stuff just ignore it like he does to you.

***
Robert also has a habit of just saying yes to things without question.
***

Hertz is very easy.

Robert immediately starts driving on the left lane. The only car to do so...

***

I ask to get wine from a roadside stand. Five minutes later Robert drives past all the stands without stopping.

Never asks if I want to stop for anything while driving.

**Something almost died.**: _14:55:47 +04_
Oncoming traffic. Dog on our side of road. It turns, sees us, and jumps IN FRONT of us, halfway into the lane, barking

**Noravank. Wow**: _18:01:15 +04_

**Camping crossroad sign**: _18:06:36 +04_

**Foggy, car passing in front of us**: _20:02:18 +04_
Stays in pass lane with left blinker on. Letting us know it's safe to follow and pass trucks

**Skip hotel offer of dinner**: _22:03:34 +04_

![deceee50f907c66bba8c0e5da204e831][72]

Because first instinct is icky potentially personal relationship type experience. Go instead for a restaurant elsewhere because that'll be transactional. Safe. Impersonal

Wish I had a travel partner who pushed against that knee jerk reaction of mine instead of reinforcing it. Mike maybe would.

Maybe build empty day or night into travel plans so I don't have initial hesitation due to giving up plansEstroganoff. It was very very good at least. Veal.

Homemade wine kinda vinegary
:star:

## Thu 31 May

**Shockingly I had to wake Robert up at 7:30**: _08:25:27 +04_
And after diddling on his phone for 30 minutes in the hotel, gets into the car and before I've even buckled asks me which way to go. And starts driving before I have the chance to look it up. Fucking infuriates me.

"How much time does this route add" he asks as he takes it and knowing I don't have data... Always demands answers to questions I can't possibly have had time to look up.



---

**> live life like you drive a rental car**: _08:53:21 +04_


---

**> "what's old?"**: _08:55:26 +04_
Robert asks as we visit Tatev. Man, do your own research.

But it does clarify to me that I enjoy logistical planning. Where to go and how to organize it. I dont like research planning. I want someone else to be the tour guide once we get there


---

**How many things have I wanted to do while traveling...**: _09:11:06 +04_
That I could reasonably be expected to not be able to do again but passed because of cost or hassle like getting a taxi to see something?
:star:

---

**Dinner then 🍞**: _09:35:09 +04_
Dinner last night was fine but I didn't feel full after just satiated. And wanted to keep eating. By the time got back to the room with grocery store bread that urge had passed and I was simply left not hungry.

That's what I need to drill in to lose the gut

**House all by itself lonesome on a steep hill**: _16:18:12 +04_ _Partly Cloudy 27°C_
_Մ-2 Armenia 39.423, 46.374_

**Have a second dog chase the car**: _16:56:21 +04_
And then later kill a bird


---

**Robert thinks every horn is directed at him**: _17:07:38 +04_
Don't be like Robert. Don't assume others are obsessed with you.


---

**NK, like much of this trip**: _18:07:43 +04_
surprisingly beautiful country and very depopulated. janapar trail probably nice


---

**Guesthouse English actually**: _20:38:45 +04_
13 year old. Very adorable and proud


---

**I really hate language barriers**: _22:42:59 +04_
The abkhaz taxi, NK guesthouse, NK restaurant (need a few minutes to order...)


## Fri 01 Jun

**Can't find NK flag to my liking**: _12:12:57 +04_
Buy the smaller one that doesn't match size of other two now, or gamble on finding a match later?

But the smaller now. Only 500. Robert points out that if do find a larger oneater I can use the smaller as a gift to someone


---

**Downpour and hail as we approach Sevan peninsula**: _18:52:03 +04_


---

**Fuel scare almost to dilijan**: _19:16:10 +04_
Because again Robert ignores all my comments on the matter. God.


---

**Robert almost runs over my foot**: _19:47:58 +04_ _Scattered Storms 20°C_
Because he fucking panics anytime someone else gets mildly upset at him. The car was in a fine place to wait 30 seconds but somebody makes a gesture and he freaks out and then gets pissed at me.

_Hovsepyan street Armenia 40.752, 44.897_

---

**This room is excessive**: _19:59:36 +04_


---

**Every damn time**: _20:01:14 +04_
Get into a room and Robert lays down to check Twitter or some shit. Never asks what I want to do. Never volunteers to take care of anything. We need to check in. Etc. Just. So. Fucking. Entirely. Self-absorbed.

**So many bike tourists in the Armenian hills**: _12:00:44 +04_
Can't imagine the effort to go up and down these hills with all that gear

**Constantly have to remind of every detail.**: _13:39:52 +04_
We're going there on the way back. 10 minutes later, "aren't we going there?"

**Debed canyon history**: _14:33:23 +04_
Thinking about the medieval and ancient history of this area. Seeing old abandoned forts and such

---

**Lots of poverty and poor infrastructure**: _16:50:57 +04_ _Scattered Storms 18°C_
But in whole trip never saw a homeless person.

The benchmark for a society should be how well off it's poorest members are, not how rich it's richest are.

Or maybe by the smallest gap between poorest and median.

I'm a socialist who paradoxically dislikes society

**Get a car wash for the rental but end up with a full blown hand detail**: _11:24:53 +04_

![e4a5208e44d290e23db634d9662d6c03][77]

Cheap but unnecessary and we actually are a bit short on time...

It took an hour!

Trying to communicate to fill the tank is curiously difficult


---

**Lots of anxiety right now with the rental return**: _12:53:36 +04_ _Mostly Sunny 23°C_
Why did Robert have to drive that shitty road?

And despite being explicitly told don't take a ticket for parking, Robert took a ticket. I theorized maybe the card we were told to show was a reader. Robert half assed waved the card and it didn't do anything. Turns out it was an RFID card :O

A tiny scratch on the bumper apparently? When the car already scratched up to begin with? On one hand be glad to escape with that only but in the other wth that's super petty
_Zvartnots International Airport Armenia 40.152, 44.401_

**In summation**: _13:38:27 +04_
Azerbaijan - don't like the persistent ripoff culture, didn't care for the cities, the north is prettier than I expected. It's very cheap.

Georgia - liked everything. But expected that. Liked Kutaisi more than I figured.

Armenia - liked the countryside far far more than expected. Disliked the cities quite a bit.

Istanbul -


---

**Bus to Tbilisi**: _13:55:10 +04_
They try to get us to pay 10000d, then 7500. But I saw no it's 7000. They acquiesce.

Robert asks if he can pay in Lira. He meant lari. Georgia's currency. Lira is Turkish...


---

**God fuck you**: _15:16:53 +04_ _Mostly Sunny 25°C_
I didn't agree to the hotel at that price. There were plenty of other options to try and get the referral code. I didn't say yes and you didn't at all double check with me. And you can say sorry without getting into a hissy fit

I really hate it when other people spend my money because of their unwillingness to make an effort. You're the one who wanted a hotel and instead of putting in some effort you'd also rather just play civ. Fine for you but why do I pay for it?

**Bemoaning the souvenir situation here**: _14:36:14 +04_
Plastic 187ml wine would be perfect


---

**Metro closed for some reason**: _20:26:26 +04_
Have to use bus. Instead of taking a minute to look up on Google what it might cost so we can be prepared, Robert just says, I have enough coins.

Irritating

Riding dirty

**Tbilisi streets with uncrossable highway thru old town ish area is pissing me off**: _21:20:15 +04_

**Lol 2 hours sitting on the tarmac waiting for entertainment system**: _14:59:20 +03_ _Partly Cloudy 25°C_
They made up no time. No way we make our connection

No announcement. No info. They rebooked without telling us. Then United says there's Alaska room. Alaska says no. Back to United and wait behind a family of like 7 for like 20 fucking minutes.

Turkish continues to offer nothing. Alaska and United friendly and helpful as possible. United gives $40 in food vouchers for basically no reason.

We dawdle a bit too much given that we aren't checked in to actual seats. I realize it in time, but Robert (per usual and hey, foreshadowing!) doesn't share my mild alarm. He moseys to finish his beer, then forgets his boarding pass!

Then overbooked standby express sitting next to death himself
