Teotihucuan
Haha, wander by a sign for free tours and like dog, take a free walking tour you moron! So I wander over to get info but it turns out that's the meeting point for a teotihucuan tour leaving in 15 minutes. For $30. Usually more than I'd impulse buy, especially for a tour I haven't vetted, but fuck it. This gets me out of trying to make my own sightseeing day and honestly, cdmx wasn't wowing me from the get go. So this way I at least get some check marks

Ended up perfect. Got to mentally regroup and the bus there and back provided two separate hourish naps to recharge

Such an uncomfortable red-eye
Middle seat, already sore back, neck stiff. Again I'd say they should design bus, train, and airplane seats primarily for sleeping. How come an airplane seat is designed to create that pocket behind your lower back unless you maintain very upright posture, which is difficult to hold. 

At least for me. But boy my posture is slouchy when I sit.

Use the neck pillow I realize because it keeps your head from tilting back too much

Anthropology museum....
It's good. Comprehensive. But dulling me out the way basically all history museums dull me out. It's so dry and frankly doesn't offer anything over Wikipedia.

There are some things that strike harder when seen in person for sure, the reconstructions, skeletons, bright colored Stone work. But they're fleeting. I wish they weren't. 

I've fought this since I started traveling though haven't I? Museums - despite my interest - don't hold my interest. I guess it's the same wish; I don't need facts here so much as an immersive experience! Get people excited to learn more. Give them a feel for the time or circumstance

Maybe it's all the introspection and visiting museums alone.![](photos/ebe69f8db798ce0c7e6d9c959c466496.jpeg)Why doesn't this has an illustration?

Missed La Ronda sights on Saturday night
Supposedly a don't miss - where the drink is widely as too. Not upset at myself for that because it was impractical to get there again that night. 

Though I do wish in retrospect that I'd stayed in the old town rather than next to the Cotopaxi excursion sight. Though again thats not bad at the moment.

More upsetting was missing the Jesus church. I passed right by it and maybe would've gone on if not for the slightly negative feeling left over from the first church - again my fault for not checking if that was for the towers or not.

Bus pretty easy to figure out
Central hall with destinations listed though not grouped really. So not the easiest to find the next Cuenca per session but I find what I'm looking for and snag the 8:10 departure

(Of course 8:10 is Latin time. 8:17 actually, not bad)

Wonder if the bus wifi will work... Appears no? There's a network for sure and pwd works but it brings to a movistar login and I'm guessing somehow the WiFi only works for movistar users?

Only downside is that with a little more available time here I may have been able to get my Puerto Lopez to Quito ticket since there is a Reina ticket booth here.

Always curious about the irregular stops, cargo transport, and prices paid away from the station. And always impressed how the fare collectors remember who they've already checked.

Bus empanadas, 4x$1 right when I started getting hungry. But they're fruit filled. Ok but I wanted savory

Religion useful? I think we should all humble ourselves to something

Capitalism good? Lifted many out of poverty and does restrict some power hoarding but destroys the planet

Number of humans and humanity with respect to other species, not special.

Non capitalist, Pastoral life an ideal? What about disease research?

Fervently anti consumerist.

Fervently pacifist but que WWII? At least somewhat reconciled by belief those responsible should be targeted. But a discord between America's Civic religion vs say the actual heroism of self sacrifice for a legit good cause

Canelazo
6 cups of water
8 cinnamon sticks
1 cup of sugar or grated panela

Instructions

1. Combine all the ingredients, except for the aguardiente, in a medium sized pot.
2. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 30-40 minutes. To make the fast or cheater version you can simply boil it for 10-15 minutes.
3. Mix in a shot of aguardiente per drink and serve immediately.

Ecuadorian aguardiente is different from Colombian aguardiente in that it doesn’t have the anise flavor that the Colombian one has. In fact, I would recommend Brazilian cachaca or even rum as a closer substitute for the aguardientes in this canelazo recipe

Dan Carlin, Griffin TTAZZ both
Too self-explanatory and digression. Take that to heart in own writing

Carlin succinctly reiterates a fascinating point: ancient armies up to ~ rennanisance are semi compatible. Afterward it's exponential. By 1900s a wwi army couldn't hold a candle to any wwii. And now?

That's one of the two most intriguing Q's about history. The other being realizing that the people living through the time didn't know how it's end. Pertinent now!

What does that mean for 50 years from now? And how will it impact digital and space. Or will it level off? Moore's law vs PC CPU and RAM rather stable

Premodern had differences and it's interesting and the military is often the most documented. Modern times are fast homogeneous and boring

This applies to all of society btw

At least it's on time, in front of old cathedral (not new, info) but it's not actually a nice bus. Worse than the one I took here. No wifi :(

Audio system a little garbled.

There's only 10 people (well plus a toddler) here 😳 almost awkward level. 4 couples too so only one other person without built in partner.

And the hostels have been empty too; I'm gathering June is definitely not a tourist season at all

Yet again I wish I spoke German. Lots of German (well could be Austrian or w/e [Dutch it turns out]) travelers. And I sat at the German end of the breakfast table. ¯_(ツ)_/¯. I should ask them for travel recommendations!

It's cold today in the mountains ~10°c

At least the breakfast isn't overpriced like Morocco was. Not was lunch. All in all a good day. If only it were clearer at the park.

Now to see if I get to use my hostel...6pm end of check-in? Can't be real. And I think I would've put a late arrival in since only reason I'm staying here instead of Lopez is because of WanderBus. But Man, two consecutive worries about check-in here.

Frustrating last experience in Ecuador
Airport bus stops at ?? But before 9. So trying other bus that's less convenient and somehow 4x the price. At least I have myself plenty of time.

Ultimately what's irritating is that if I'd have just known ahead of time I could've planned something different. Maybe gone up to centennial Park straight from otavalo and explored the park plus the female brewery

Store your pack on walking days, idiot

But it's also hot, and unam disappointed, and my energy level was low to begin with.

Did end up rallying to visit the zocalo area. Saw the postal building, the cathedral, templo mayor, and a native festival?

Finally had all the free time in the world for a lounge
It was nice. And I still managed to push it to final boarding call.

And then dropped my pillow in the bathroom. Luckily realized but just after having boarding pass checked! They let me retrieve it but then had to go enhanced screening.

Then my seat was taken, good naturedly, but there's an aisle seat open in row ahead! And with an empty middle to boot. Hot damn.
