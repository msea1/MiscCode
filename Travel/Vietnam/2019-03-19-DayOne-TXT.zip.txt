Wonder if I'm getting scammed by Hanoi hostel

Person claims to be employee, and did know my reservation, but also not official hostel number. Had to pay from a link, which failed. Then Giving away some key information over WhatsApp to get a Ha Long Bay trip reserved. Although so far not much more than they'd have from a reservation.

Eve of the trip

I feel full of nerves. The car needs to go. My bed needs to go. Work has been screwy with the midweek night shift. Mary - the absolute most compatible person I've ever met on personality and chattiness, who also combines attractiveness and an amazing dog - feels not in the right place to date.

I'm so ugh.

Similar somewhat I think to Cuba. And Balkans? Maybe it's just how I feel before solo trips. I need someone else to feed off to be upbeat?

Not sure I've ever wanted to ditch a trip as much as this. Not nerves like with Nicaragua or Cuba. Just apathy.

Different travel moods depending on the area of the world

So far my mood in Hanoi more matches Hong Kong where I was not as ambitious as usual. Maybe something to do with mega city as well? Though I was exhaustive in Tokyo? Dunno.

So far I'm not jazzed here. Not the rush I think I usually feel. Linz always stands out for some reason. 

Maybe it's because it's just that much more foreign and so I feel more constantly separate, and unable to delve in. For future, emulate Bourdain more? Gonna kinda try with cooking class and food tour

But also, travel isn't all about enjoying where I am. It's also about getting away from home. A chance to think and reflect without trappings. Obviously it'd be awesome to so enjoy the new place that I'm finally able to live in the present - something I recognize as part of my obsession with traveling - but it's no surprise giceny life right now that reflection is more a weight in my mind

	Date:		October 27, 2018 at 18:08:20 PDT

Winter trip thoughts

None of the ideas particularly grabbed me and I wonder if traveling for the sake of it will just illicit more feelings Ike this Hanoi trip.

Plus I'll have Japan just a month later.

Plus I'm likely not to get the two Thanksgiving bonus days I was planning on die to cutting off 24/7 ops. 

All in all though this probably isn't the best time to be obsessing about it. Maybe get car, Mary, bed sorted first and see how I feel post Alaska. Then I won't really have other crises pulling me down (haha)

A pool is quite refreshing

After a long day of walking to just soak and back float for a little bit. The key is to not go into it expecting a long time. Just like with a hot tub, 10-15 minutes is plenty. After that seems to dull. Perhaps all the hot springs and spas have it right after all!

The street chaos works...

I never saw an accident or anything. But then I wondered about how inefficient it was, how slow traffic has to go. Then I thought, good! Except it's not peaceful for pedestrians either so it does actually seem less than ideal all the way around. But ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Very good. Totally worth it. Only wish was that there was a little bit of info on how the process usually works wrt getting a nseat, sharing a table, ordering, paying, etc. But I also could've asked more forcefully...

Funny story

Drinking game of each person coming up with a question and asking each person in a circle. 

After a few rounds the question was "what do you wish you had but don't?". It came around to an Argentinian who answered "confidence". 

Next round was "what do you wish you could do but haven't?". It gets around to the Argentinian and he turns a Japanese girl in the circle and answers, with a sexy latin drawl, "I've wanted to kiss you since this morning." And he says he's lacking confidence!!

The kicker is that his accent was thick enough that her response was "what? I'm sorry I don't understand." ! So like five people of various nationality were trying to translate. It lost all suave üòÇ

Apathy

Yesterday after shower I laid in bed starting at 7pm and never got up until 7am today. Then had breakfast and back to bed until 10. No real enthusiasm or energy to do anything. Hasn't been terrible, I just...meh. possibly Mary related. And the car. The future doesn't hold excitement either short or long term. What do I have to look forward to??

Mary also demonstrates the frustration because it was a match to long convo to meet to infatuation within 24 hours. It can happen out of nowhere at anytime so not trying feels like closing off hope. 

Hope is a killer.

Having a travel plan means that stuff gets done

Even if I'm depressed. And eventually I'll likely forget my mood at the time and just remember what I saw. 

Without a plan, more likely to say fuck it. Which ultimately I kick myself for because I'll forget what depressed feels like and does to energy and willpower
