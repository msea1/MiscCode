Free mezes or...?

![](photos/43330386840336abc5d6cf7878ed26ce.jpeg "")

I hate the awkwardness of not knowing what's free and what might be an exorbitant ripoff in different cultures

I guess finding out is the basis for a funny story though either way?

39m for the food holy fucking hell. A kebab is like 3. Hate feeling taken advantage of, or being a rube. Also hate paying $25 for some chips, smoked cheese, and lemon slices with sugar. Even an airport would be ashamed to charge that.

Can't shake the anger. 39m would buy a good steak dinner for two! But also ultimately it's $20. God I'm broken.

Trying to look at it like a counseling lesson. Maybe now I won't feel awkward about being straight forward and asking "what is this?" and "how much does it cost?"

But so far three incidents in like 6 hours:
- No Bus, Taxi drivers
- Hostel putting us in 12-person dorm despite paying for 6-person
- The above

Loooooong siesta
Went back to the hostel around 1p meaning to escape the sun and think of what to do.

Used a decent chunk of time interacting on tinder. A couple prostitutes. Weirdly the rate seems to be for two hours. Ranges from 100 to 150

Anyways, ended up falling asleep and instead of a cat nap, everytime ibwokenup there was no motivation to do anything so went back to sleep. Stayed in bed until 8:30! Not going to be great for getting on a normal schedule but oh well.

Larger picture I'm just not very excited by Baku. Can't quite tell why. Even in places not my fancy I usually get an energy boost from arriving. Instead I'm more wondering if I'll feel so nonplussed all trip. Maybe I'm just put off by the disappointing hostel and bulvar rip-off?

![](photos/458500a569bed537592170e46a7ea8d5.jpeg "")

The funicular going up had doors closed and locked despite running time until 10p it said (it was 9:30 at the time). I opted for the stairs and Robert true to form decided to wait and see. 

Result is that I've been up here by the Soviet statue for 20 minutes. But it's nice. There's a persistent gentle breeze and the square is rather deserted leaving me unbothered and free to reflect. Robert comes along sooner than expected too.

I travel and avoid social interactions almost to a fault. No taxis or haggling or trying to learn from locals, preferring to do research ahead of time. I say it's to not look foolish and be taken advantage of.

(or be vulnerable? though when I've been truly vulnerable people have been amazing)

Deposite not really eating today and passing an abundance of late night döner stands for 3.5m, I didn't get one. Probably because of the bulvar thing but I can pretend it's because I'm not hungry and rationally decided not to eat just for the sake of eating cheaply.

Baku metro, to Sheki
Almost take an Uber to bus station but decide on metro instead. Get to see how deep it runs, for bomb shelter purposes.

Trying to decide on bus vs maxitaxi. Bus looks old probably not aircon and the guide says buses take less interesting route. So opt for typical maxitaxi can, 7m that leaves 50 minutes later. Supposedly.

Kish Albanian Church
Opens at 9 am. About 45-60 minute walk, or 10 minute taxi, or ? minute bus, away and if I were on my own I'd likely check out, walk there, then taxi to his station trying to catch the 10am maxi to Qax. 

Actually that's not a good idea even as I hypothetically create it. Too little room for error in getting that maxi and the alternative isn't great after that.

Going to see Kish and the exterior doesn't seem worth it. The interior museum and artifacts do. 

I probably would've done it yesterday by going maxi to palace to hostel, rest, then church. But couldn't because Robert. 

Hard to accept not doing things even if they're likely somewhat marginal. As soon as I can't do it I start attaching all this mythos and prestige to it. I envision being able to tell a story about it and feel moved by it. Far more likely I won't and wouldn't.

The habit of always pushing time
Leaves at 8 acted on like we can show up at 8 or little later

We need to pick up the pace a little and no change or even acknowledgement

Aaron is me except at all times while I try to only be like it when pressing against a deadline. But my trips usually feature a lot of deadlines since I pack them so tight. Which works for me solo.

(Also wouldn't be so tight in this case if it wasn't always 10-15 minutes from ok let's go to actually going) and I hate feeling like I have to be the schedule master at all times. Like pulling teeth multiple times a day. Puts me in a foul mood

Qax
Watched the minibus pass us (empty) on walk to bus station, then it's not there when we arrive at 8:02

Go via zaqatala or balakan? Or taxi to Qax (15, down to 12, probably get down to 10).

Only 26 manat left between us makes the connection to Tbilisi a little worrisome?

Robert's not wrong about bartering here is a little gross. But I'm not wrong about not taking first offers on principle. 

Also irritates me that he'd be so blithe "let's just get a taxi". I know it's not actually that much money, (see also remarking on beer costs of 4.5m) it's the relative inflation I'm just noting. Taxi is 6x more expensive and we didn't catch the maxi because of you.

For me, continue fighting notion of trying to save pennies at every opportunity. Remember Bend? It was a little anxious to be so careless but not bad. Remember that the point isn't to save it's to experience. If frugality becomes it's own goal then you've lost. 

Hard for me to walk that line. Noting also that just an hour ago we were making fun of Kirk for his lack of money sense and just spending without thinking

Gori and beyond
So hard and frustrating to have daily planning discussion because Robert never remembers any details even from conversations a few hours ago. Have to constantly backtrack and explain timing and logistics. So his suggestion are rarely helpful and it just wastes time. And frustrates me because how are you this forgetful?

So stop having them? Travel like you would on your own. You wouldn't have this discussion with yourself.

Rare case of being approached by girls and not a scam?
Two girls approach is at bus station first speaking Russian I think then English. Saying their going to Gori but just two girls and don't want to get scammed. They ask to travel together.

Seems super fishy especially since one is very very attractive and wearing upscale clothes not at all fit for maxitaxi travel.

But as we walk towards maxis they don't try to steer us to anything or engage in conversation. Seems actually genuine. They follow us to the van and also get in and also pay.

Gori and Kutaisi
So far a day I worried about how transport would work is going fine and languid. Not feeling rushed and enjoying the day. Having to skip some slightly out of town stuff like mtskheta and up caves and kut monastery but successfully not fretting.

Welp, no transportation to Kutaisi (bus would've cost 20l [for 2]). But instead of paying 80l for taxi get maxi to Khassuri for 6l, leaving in 20 and then we'll see.

Think 60l would've been ok price from Gori. Khassuri is ~1/3 way there so if no maxi I'd consider 40l total for taxi rest of way a fair deal. 

Taxi less than 5x the bus cost is generally ok in my book

1503 - maxi breaks down. 🧐

I'm very reliant on Latin script. Place names (ie bus placards) in non Latin confound me.

Ask for help spotting a van and Robert sits down facing away from the oncoming vans. Guarantee he's going to just say he doesn't think one is coming, (or that they all look uncomfortable) without offering an action. He's going to want a taxi but not do anything about it

Eventually after waiting 15 minutes to no avail we cross the street and find a taxi stand. Guy asks where we going and after a breif language barrier per usual we come to an understanding in Spanish! 20l to Kutaisi. A pretty good steal.

He asks for address. I forget taco comes with Dustin dog (taxi comes with custom drop off) who is nice because Kutaisi isn't super convenient station. It comes at price of 10l more but saves us like 5km. 

Would kyle do this?

The stranger trust here compared to say Azerbaijan or even taxi in Seattle.

Taxi vs maxi cost benefit analysis. But I do wish Robert wouldn't be so damn preachy about it after the fact. If you have a reason to prefer a taxi bring it up beforehand! Defend your point!

There are good reasons for taxis that appeal to me. Speed and convenience of custom drop off. Fun driving. Potentially able to ask for photo stops.

It's a natural gas taxi.

Why does Georgia have both cars with left and right hand drive?

Can't give homeless services
Because not all deserve it. A) they think 90% are grifters choosing to be homeless. But even if you get them to agree most aren't they'll fall back on the anecdotes of a few bad apples and say you can't justify helping them even if you'd mostly help good people.

But take that logic and apply it to collateral damage and civilian casualties and their argument is immediately 180. We have to bomb for the greater good even if there's collateral damage.

Their dry matted fur reminds me of rocket when I first got him and silently was very disappointed. Wonders what bathing and brushing does.

To Mestia
Really struggling with the taxi v bus decision. Really want to just do the easy bus option whereas the progressive choice is probably taxi?

Also I'm getting disquieting vibes about abkhazia the closer it gets

Plan for Mestia is hike to chal glacier? Long hike for sure but maybe good for me. Not much to do in town anyways. 

Will have to get going early tmrw morning for marsh to Zugdidi

If the girls would've joined us would've made taxi decision easy. Only extra 25l each plus saves 2, maybe 3 hours! Able to leave about 8:30 instead of 10:30 and drives faster. Plus maybe photo stops. Plus nicer ride. 

But I can understand their hesitation. Two stranger guys, four to a taxi isn't always comfortable. And Robert tried to sell the taxis speed by mentioning the risky fast driving. Not how to sell it!

Petro prices here appear to be 2.45l which is $1. Per gallon? That's unusual. But per liter would mean very expensive

Intertia and following the girls wins out and it's maxi. Little sad about not having the wind and views and speed of a taxi but relieved at the price and somewhat comfort of other travelers. 

But now watch this be very uncomfortable...

Not too bad actually. Tinted windows that don't open though. 

Sure are a lot of Germans here

Mestia
Goal is chalbaardi glacier hike. Ethno museum would be a plus if able to do that then taxi out to hike and walk back. Guessing 4+ hours RT for the hike. Want to be back by 8:30 so have to leave by 4 could be ok but kinda pushing it. With taxi, say leave by 6 or 5:30 to be safe (esp if w/Robert)

- Tbilisi To Gori To Kutaisi -- *turned out ok with taxi*
- Abkhazia Border & Getting To Sukhomi -- *turned out ok but very justified in my anxiety!*
- Visa -- *discovered Morning Of Not Open Weekends, * turned out to work ok
- Return To Border -- getting a taxi to border proved weirdly hard but overall no problem. Didn't get to keep the visa :(
- Night Train -- *appears to be no problem* was no problem except stuffy
- Agdam -- skipped
- Leaving NK -- no problem
- Returning Rental -- ...dinged...

Panic about abkhazia
Rereading the guide to get a sense of the overview again I encounter that the MFA is open 9-5 m-f **only**

Best case I think is we're in sukhomi at 2:30, realistic case is 4...

And you have to pay for the visa at a bank and their hours are unknown...

Abkhazia is on Moscow time instead of Gerogia time so it's one hour behind, buying us another hour...

Why didn't we catch this in advance? Could've switched around to do abkhazia yesterday. I know I blanked, seeing NK visa office open 7 days a week. 

But how come the myriad of personal blogs that detail getting to abkhazia never mention weekend issues?

I think we can pull this off and I think there's better odds than not we try but this is not a smart play I think. Downside is were stuck there untill getting a visa on Monday, meaning out on the two yours that I most wanted to do.

Meanwhile the alternative plan is realistically good, head to batumi. 

And prior to the visa thing I was feeling very anxious about this section of the trip. I woke up at 3am and couldn't go back to sleep. Now I'm offered a lifeline to bail on it and all I feel is disappointment. 

***
I hate feeling like I chicken out on something. Like I'm eternally comparing myself to some mythical (Australian) backpacker. That's dumb. 

And that I'll feel like I let people down when I return having not lived up to my goals. They won't actually care. Also why should I?

Do I want to go to abkhazia for me? Or to be able to tell others? To have a one up card against other stories?

I do want to go for me, it seems interesting and cool. But have to acknowledge that others plays a big draw in it as well and it should not.

Isn't going to Georgia etc a good enough story? Goes back again to things going according to plan does not make for good (enough) stories.
***

I wonder if missing out on abkhazia because of a planning oversight would convince Robert to take planning more seriously. (Haha, no)

Batumi is the smart call. Sukhomi is the "good story" call. Being trapped is a funny story and missing the yours sucks but isn't a life breaker if I assume I'm coming back. And can do kakheti tour the last Monday before flying out, or a self Kazbegi tour.

To Zugdidi
Have the backseat of the maxi to myself and a pile of bags so that's pretty nice

Get into Zugdidi with time. Confirm maxis to batumi available. Confirm night train available with tickets.

13:30 arrive at Abkhazia border. Cleared first stop in 15. 

Second one taking much longer. Putting time for visa at risk. Waited in front of two way mirror post for 20 minutes. 

Then escorted across street, past a fence, past another fence and taken to a portable office where our passports are handed to a senior looking fellow. On the wall of the office is a nap and the other wall has a giant Russian flag with an eagle logo and Russia spelled out...

We're escorted back to our original spot and told to wait ten minutes. It takes fifty until a guy comes to question us. His insignia is three stars in a triangle with two more stars from the top.

He asks basic questions. How long, where, asks about previous trips (Ukraine). It takes maybe 5 minutes. Then he hands passports back and simply says 
> welcome

I wonder how that process plays out if we're Canadian or if we had a Russian visa

The entire time I felt basically no reaction

Abkhazia Visa
Through the border at 3pm Georgia time. Right at the fucking limit. Should be 2pm local time. We should get there with an hour to spare. But we've heard be there by 4 (our host), by 5 (MFA itself), by 6 (lonely planet).

A finish is not worth it
50l but no change for 60 and the stupidly paid 20 more for brief view of tits. Good tits though. I miss tits. But whats dumb is that a finish, after an hour of massage build up took like one minute. Very not worth the cost.

But it's not really related to traveling so I think note it here, 80l ($32) and keep it off budget. After all, remember to spend your money?

Really want to feel a snatch though and that doesn't seem like a thing here. Surprisingly little info online.

The massage is good though. Legit. And only 60l / hour

Should've done wine tour on last day of trip. Could've gone to Armenia one day sooner, returned one day sooner. Leaves last Sunday open for museum and also if we wanted to buy Georgian wine could buy it on tour and immediately bring it home. And made for a logistically relaxing final day.

We don't have much time in yerevan so trying to figure out if tour makes sense wrt. Cuts down on alaverdi later but also takes extra 6 hours to reach yerevan.

My urge is to discuss with Robert but what's the point? He can't keep simple details correct in his head and therefore rarely provides good insight. Best case is he gets me to think of an idea in a new way

Best and brightest thoughts
Keep being treated, thought of, analyzed as, a military war. But it was a political war. Body counts don't matter. Civilian morale does. And the SV govt was corrupt and out of touch :o

Military loyalty to itself rather than to the truth and trust in it's civilian oversight. Thinking it knows better. Do the civilians want us there? Eg Iraq

Catch-22: If you aren't considered loyal to your brothers you won't find the truth that you need to tell to others outside your brotherhood. And when dissent is punished then you only get failure.

Question the information's loyalty.

Sack people who are wrong.

Judgement on the pillow
Not useful for maxitaxi because to use as lower back rest you need more legroom. And as butt rest it pitches my posture forward. Good for sleeping though. 

The backpack pillow probably better idea for future trips since it takes up so little room and does 90% of the job

I travel...
To experience new places and cultures. And to leave my home world behind. To give me thought about what I take for granted and discover gratitude or new ideas. Luxury travel insulates me from that latter part and dampens the experience.

Getting rental
Lost about two hours time figuring out the bus. Hopefully figuring out the bus... And then it literally drives right by our hostel. Should've asked hostel. Keep forgetting that. 

Sickening thought that there are two airports. But wikivoyage definitely said Zvarnots...

Robert's routine of laying in bed for two hours then complaining about wasting time waiting for a bus and instead we should take a taxi is infuriating. Don't make me pay for your shit

And don't give me shit like I was laying in bed too. I was laying in bed, completely packed. I don't need to be your task master at all hours. Show your own fucking initiative.

Not fucking fair that I do all the planning then have to be tour guide and drill sergeant and pay extra for your high maintenance.

But getting upset at him doesn't do any good. He'll never ever change or realize or acknowledge it. So why bother. If he says stuff just ignore it like he does to you.

***
Robert also has a habit of just saying yes to things without question.
***

Hertz is very easy. 

Robert immediately starts driving on the left lane. The only car to do so...

***

I ask to get wine from a roadside stand. Five minutes later Robert drives past all the stands without stopping. 

Never asks if I want to stop for anything while driving.

Skip hotel offer of dinner
Because first instinct is icky potentially personal relationship type experience. Go instead for a restaurant elsewhere because that'll be transactional. Safe. Impersonal

Wish I had a travel partner who pushed against that knee jerk reaction of mine instead of reinforcing it. Mike maybe would.

Maybe build empty day or night into travel plans so I don't have initial hesitation due to giving up plans

Shockingly I had to wake Robert up at 7:30
And after diddling on his phone for 30 minutes in the hotel, gets into the car and before I've even buckled asks me which way to go. And starts driving before I have the chance to look it up. Fucking infuriates me.

"How much time does this route add" he asks as he takes it and knowing I don't have data... Always demands answers to questions I can't possibly have had time to look up.

Robert asks as we visit Tatev. Man, do your own research.

But it does clarify to me that I enjoy logistical planning. Where to go and how to organize it. I dont like research planning. I want someone else to be the tour guide once we get there

Dinner then 🍞
Dinner last night was fine but I didn't feel full after just satiated. And wanted to keep eating. By the time got back to the room with grocery store bread that urge had passed and I was simply left not hungry.

That's what I need to drill in to lose the gut

Lots of poverty and poor infrastructure
But in whole trip never saw a homeless person.

The benchmark for a society should be how well off it's poorest members are, not how rich it's richest are.

Or maybe by the smallest gap between poorest and median.

Why did Robert have to drive that shitty road?

And despite being explicitly told don't take a ticket for parking, Robert took a ticket. I theorized maybe the card we were told to show was a reader. Robert half assed waved the card and it didn't do anything. Turns out it was an RFID card :O

A tiny scratch on the bumper apparently? When the car already scratched up to begin with? On one hand be glad to escape with that only but in the other wth that's super petty

	Date:		June 3, 2018 at 02:38:27 PDT

In summation
Azerbaijan - don't like the persistent ripoff culture, didn't care for the cities, the north is prettier than I expected. It's very cheap.

Georgia - liked everything. But expected that. Liked Kutaisi more than I figured.

Armenia - liked the countryside far far more than expected. Disliked the cities quite a bit.

Istanbul -

I didn't agree to the hotel at that price. There were plenty of other options to try and get the referral code. I didn't say yes and you didn't at all double check with me. And you can say sorry without getting into a hissy fit

I really hate it when other people spend my money because of their unwillingness to make an effort. You're the one who wanted a hotel and instead of putting in some effort you'd also rather just play civ. Fine for you but why do I pay for it?
