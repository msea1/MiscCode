A key goal this trip

Don't sweat it! You're going to see the Cherry blossoms and that's the overwhelming goal. Achieve that and it's a success.

After that, enjoy the train scenery.

After that, do weird Japanese things like an owl Cafe

Finally, last, cross off city sights.

Priority Pass restaurant

Good thing Robert reminded me of this before the trip. The one line in PDX was closed to priority pass when I arrived so I detoured to the available Cafe and got a good meal for the cost of a few spare bucks in tip. 

Did eventually get into the lounge and it was lousy with amenities. Previewing what's available in Narita and I'm starting to think that Hanoi and Taipei fucked my expectations curve

Forgot a towel :/

Grabbed the delta blanket as a backstop

Jetlag

There's something so odd about spending all day on a plane and them just wanting to lay down and sleep. Like, I didn't expend any energy. 

Though in this case it makes sense because I didn't nap on the flight and Seattle time it's 1am and I awoke at 5:30 on little sleep.

I think if I could make it to like 8pm before crashing that'd be good but I'm trying not to force anything. It'd feel accomplishing to get the Tokyo stuff done but ehhhh, see how I feel after a shower. And also where I need to go tomorrow to get rail pass and Hiroshima train.

Tokyo Stuff
• Owl Cafe
• Godzilla
• Ghibli clock
• Rainbow bridge

Ended up with decent initial energy burst. Walked through the shrine I ended my trip with last time (makes sense) and browsed the blossoms along Sumida Park. Then got Lawson's takeaway and now back to sleep.

Take more selfies?

I hate how they look but plain ass photos are never super interesting. Get one or two then the rest are culled. Better, more interesting long term to get shots with you on them? If only the quality wasn't shit

What have been my favorite travel days?

And how to use that to inform future travels.

• Netherlands north sea park
• Netherlands train day
• Westmalle
• (Robert's Swiss train day)
• Anything involving trains really. Remember Linz and such

Travel thoughts on the ground

Some random thoughts on travel planning: I may be getting better at allowing myself freedom to just be in a place, but one thing this first morning in Japan has reminded me of is that I like to have the first few steps of the day already researched. That way I can relax into the day and not wake up and immediately feel like I'm behind schedule or that I don't know what I'm doing / when to get out of bed / etc.

Tokyo to Hiroshima to Kyoto is the example here. I knew that's what I wanted to do, but didn't have any other plan other than knowing that roughly that was doable.

I woke up this morning and had to figure out:
- Which train station in Tokyo I was going to.
- When the JR Pass office opened
- The bullet train timetable to Hiroshima
- Based on that, when I had to leave the hostel this morning
- The check-in times for my hostel in Kyoto

It can be as simple as here's the opening times of a few things, or the transit timetable. But, like, have the day until 10am semi-figured out.

Kobe

Could've got my pass earlier. Doesn't have to start that day. Doh.

Helm of a time finding the falls

Missed the train by one minute

Shit on by a bird

UW cherries

Little funny to be over here for the blossoms when I don't pay too much special attention to the blossoms on campus

	Date:		March 30, 2019 at 23:10:12 PDT

Bizarre OH conversation

Retired women seemingly booking long cruises on a whim. Iceland plus Greenland. Spend lots of time traveling, recounting recent trips. Seem Indian?

Then mention they like taking local buses on the cruise stops because the official activities are too expensive. Can't tell if these are my dream future selves or rich soiled people.

	Date:		March 31, 2019 at 02:53:43 PDT

Token entry fee

Lots of attraction here charge small entry fees like 200-300¥. I wonder why. Almost seems like such a small amount that your don't net much after staffing

Osaka to Kyoto is only 14 minutes

I should have just booked four nights in Osaka and commuted to Kyoto. Would've saved me a little time and like $10 since Kyoto is more expensive lodging

	Date:		March 31, 2019 at 18:54:24 PDT

Kyoto

Is very very flat

Maybe a few days still until max bloom. Try to swing back around before Tokyo.

	Date:		March 31, 2019 at 22:54:43 PDT

Not shopping for souvenirs

Saves a lot of time and some money.

Buy made things with meaning, instead of produced things

	Date:		March 31, 2019 at 23:32:19 PDT

People pose for far too long

Or line up 15 shots. It's time wasting and holds up others for no reason

A few days early o. Timing

Mild irritating that blossoms got delayed a few days in Osaka and Kyoto. I was all set to be literally perfectly timed and then a couple days set things slightly awry. Will try to adjust. Do want to catch at least one full bloom somewhere. Fall back is Tokyo.

Just mildly stressful that I'll be putting my eggs in the last two days basket since Osaka and Kyoto don't enter full bloom until Thursday by current expectation and Thur/Fri are my Nagano days.

	Date:		April 1, 2019 at 19:04:24 PDT

Goofed and left Nagano Rez intact

Oops. Not a huge problem hopefully as worst case can just eat the $56, realistic case is that was planning on being in that region anyways, though more likely Kanazawa or something but eh. Lodging doesn't matter too much with a train pass and at least the Nagano hostel isn't far from the Jr station.

Asked for free cancellation but actually wouldn't mind keeping it probably.

I am most comfortable and at peace wearing a backpack, walking to nowhere in particular

And a dog never tires of that

Just think, I originally wanted to come a week earlier

Figuring out travel in Ukraine is kinda my Nome

Because that's my wilderness, having to interact. Survival skills aside, the bush feels like home, like peace.

Traveling with Robert

It's nice to have company, and wacky ideas, and shared memories, and cover for being culturally awkward

But there's also a lot of waiting, slower mornings, slower walking, constant explanation, a feeling of burden, etc

Felt bad about Robert's train

Because I always feel responsible but I'm not! He's a adult with agency's

	Date:		April 5, 2019 at 21:11:45 PDT

Train sudden stop right after a station

No idea what's going on as all the announcements are in Japanese

And on queue, somehow an English translation of this comes on:

"We have stopped due to a collision with a small animal"

Later my local hop to Kanda was delayed due to "person on tracks"

	Date:		April 6, 2019 at 00:12:46 PDT

A nice part of my traveling

It's always going to bed exhausted. But I also forget that part when packing. Don't need to bring distraction material
