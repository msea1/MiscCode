TONKS PLAN

AIMS: house/crate training, introduce to stimuli, socialize, no resource guarding, basic obedience

HOUSE TRAINING

Meal: 20 minutes, 1/2 C, 5 hours apart (7am, Noon, 5pm)
Meal + 0.5 hours: Bathroom, walk, play, back to create
Meal + 2 hours: repeat bathroom cycle
Meal + 3.5 hours: repeat bathroom cycle
 
In the first stages of house-training your puppy, it is best to take him outside to eliminate every 1.5 hours. Give him some water to drink about fifteen minutes before taking him outside.

    - If you catch your puppy in the act, clap loudly so he knows he’s done something unacceptable. Then take him outside by calling him or taking him gently by the collar. When he’s finished, praise him or give him a small treat.
    - Keep the puppy on a regular feeding schedule and take away his food between meals. Give him ~20 minutes to eat.
    - Take puppy out to eliminate:
        -- first thing in the morning
        -- once every ~hour
        -- after meals
        -- when he wakes from a nap
        -- last thing at night
        -- before he’s left alone.

FOR EACH COMMAND (~20x each step)
    1. CT each time complete behavior performed.
    2. Add cue word; wait for behavior. Don't lure with treat. CT each time.
    3. Reward only best/quickest responses, ~1/2.
    4. Change the environment (flooring, my position, garage, dog run, etc) and back to step 1
    5. Vary the distractions (do at playfield periphery, back to step 1)
        May require high value treats!

SOCIALIZING:
    Remember: utilize long leash; give rewards on good behavior; remove from bad behavior

    (Mark & Move) - Upon distraction, halt; keep leash loose, give cue (leave, touch) & try to distract away. MARK on disengagement, THEN move, THEN treat.

Notes:
    Spunky / bold: shows little fear; keeps engaging with her much bigger (55 pound shepherd) brother even as he keeps dominating her in play.

    Likes to chase things.

    Settled down with crate after just one night, if near human. Sleeps well through the night.
