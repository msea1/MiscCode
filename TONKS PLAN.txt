TONKS PLAN

AIMS: house/crate training, introduce to stimuli, socialize, no resource guarding, basic obedience

FOR EACH COMMAND (~20x each step)
    1. CT each time complete behavior performed.
    2. Add cue word; wait for behavior. Don't lure with treat. CT each time.
    3. Reward only best/quickest responses, ~1/2.
    4. Change the environment (flooring, my position, garage, dog run, etc) and back to step 1
    5. Vary the distractions (do at playfield periphery, back to step 1)
        May require high value treats!

SOCIALIZING:
    Remember: utilize long leash; give rewards on good behavior; remove from bad behavior

    (Mark & Move) - Upon distraction, halt; keep leash loose, give cue (leave, touch) & try to distract away. MARK on disengagement, THEN move, THEN treat.
