Factors

I vest 7,126 shares per month right now. Though that will halve at end of year. Unless more options come.

Remember, w/r/t AMT "benefit", any long-term cap gains only happen AFTER the AMT benefit.

Current AMT cutoffs are potentially temporary

WA currently has no state income or capital gains tax, but that could change as soon as this year.



Questions

 - If I exercise options before April 15, then I can sell in early 2021, get long-term gains rate, and free up captial to pay the tax? But what will the IRS say about owing them a huge amount? Are they more forgiving when it's AMT-caused?
 
 - Does first-time home purchase offset anything? Or are there any other ways to offset tax burden?
 
 - AMT credit when caused by long-term gains?



Scenarios

** TRY TO GAME EXERCISE AROUND AMT BUDGET **
2021: Sell LT (say for 1.25M) and exercise up to AMT budget ($26,711 --> 2,671 shares, leaving 65K)
2022: Owe extra $175,000 in tax due to AMT?

Overall, I never accrue enough AMT cushion to exercise all my vested shares. Plus I get hit with about 28.8% tax rate on the first sale due to the later AMT hit
 
 
** EXERCISE AND SELL ASAP **
2021: Exercise 130,000 shares and sell Dec 31, all at $10/share. Would end up owing $670K b/c of the gains, equalling right about 29.5%. Even if the short-term gains do affect my LT rate + surtax, that only adds ~$40K, so 29.5 to 31.1%.

It's slightly more in tax up front, but I realize the gains much quicker and divest myself from company stock; a good thing if I don't trust the company stock vs the overall market.

Since it's short-term no matter what, can wait to exercise shares until late Dec when am sure of the sale value.

If blackout extends into 2022

By end of year, sell ~1.75M in short and ~1.25M in long. Tax bill of 878K = 29.3%, and maybe a 28K AMT credit? Would drop to 28.3% then.


** SELL LT ASAP, EXERCISE REST AS SOON AS BLACK-OUT OVER AND EARLY IN YEAR **
Can use proceeds from LT sale to pay-off AMT benefit. Can sell ST exercise if stock dips, or if stock out-gains market, hold to get LT gains the following year.
