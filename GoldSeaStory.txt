Backstory

The conclave in the vastwood has learned of a gathering shadow in the far north. Wicked magic and the undead essence of the shadowfel is seeping into the world. It's a slow trickle, for now, but it's influence is growing.

Part of that gathering influence is the dark creatures' seeming ability to attach themselves to living vessels. Several mapmaking and treasure hunting expeditions to the north have returned to Rium with dire afflictions. These are the occurances you were looking at.

Through your investigation, you learned of a cartography master named Thelany Hale who returned from one such outing slain. Hale, however, was a man of great influence and was able to be returned from the dead. Upon his return, however, he complained of tormenting visions and nightmares.

What happened to Hale, you're not sure, but your investigation traced this shadow to a reclusive tribe of orcs: the black hand orcs

The black hand is unique among orcs. They control fixed territory and almost never raid or engage in warfare. What they do, however, is watch over an ancient breach between the shadowfel and our world

You suspect this is the source of the gathering shadow, but you're unsure how these deeply spiritual and unusual orcs will react to this news...or if they're the ones responsible

--- Introduction to group ---

You've watched them from afar for a couple days. They've recently linked up with a group of dwarven hunters. They fought off a mated pair of wyvren (so you know they're capable) and the small bits you've caught of their conversation you've caught, the black hand clan was mentioned more than once

their mention of a particular orc tomb is very interesting and very troubling to you. so you can be rather sure that they're chasing the same leads as you are and, having watched them for a little while, they're PROBABLY not overtly evil. at least not most of them. and they even seem pretty capable, maybe helpful to your own agenda.
