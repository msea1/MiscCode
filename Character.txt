Circle of the Shepherd: Totem is Unicorn Spirit

The riverâ€™s endless flow reminds you of the great span of the world. You seek to act with the long-term interests of nature in mind.

Carries a small bundle of herbs tied together which carry the scent of my favorite play area in the Vastwood

0-3: travels
3-30: vastwood
30-40: Rium
40-41: travels to the north

Born to Ulfaren mother, Vastwood father, out of mother's wedlock. She was killed for the betrayal. Tensions caused between otherwise diplomatic Mei'lani and Ulfaren. Traveled with indifferent father, no siblings.

Studied Sylvan because wants to understand the history. Has an internal conflict between devotion to past (conservative) with desire for the Ul-socialness (progressive)

Emnity toward Ul, conflicting devotion to Vastwood, sent by the enclave (b/c of her half-elf appearance) to observe and report in Rium around rumors of shadow specters, frsutrated by lack of context, bored/disgusted by Rium's mercantile fetish, takes to sailing to get away from the crowds, leaves to go north on a lead (potentially angering the enclave for leaving her post),

DESIRE: Ul to be opened up, a mixed bag of wanting social welfare available to all but also nature/wilds to be preserved. A sense of fraternal community and purpose.
