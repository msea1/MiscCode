    Spells
        I "know" all spells. I can prepare 10 btw each long rest, whatever ones I want.

        However, I can cast up to my available slot levels. Except for cantrips, which are infinte.

        Ritual spells take longer to cast, but do not use a spell slot

OTHER PROF

    CIRCLE OF THE SHEPHERD -- Druids of the Circle of the Shepherd commune with the spirits of nature, especially the spirits of beasts and the fey, and call to those spirits for aid. These druids recognize that all living things play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on protecting animals and fey creatures that have difficulty defending themselves. Shepherds, as they are known, see such creatures as their charges. They ward off monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on rare animal habitats and on sites sacred to the fey. Many of these druids are happiest far from cities and towns, content to spend their days in the company of animals and the fey creatures of the wilds. Members of this circle become adventurers to oppose forces that threaten their charges or to seek knowledge and power that will help them safeguard their charges better. Wherever these druids go, the spirits of the wilderness are with them.

    WILD SHAPE PHB 66 -- Max CR is 1/2, no flying speed.
        You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature.
        You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn.
        You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.
        While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
            • Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom , and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
            • When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.
            • You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you’ve already cast.
            • You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
            • You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.


    SPIRIT TOTEM (Hawk): I can call forth nature spirits to influence the world around you. As a bonus action, you can magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The spirit creates an aura in a 30-foot radius around that point. It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the creature it represents. As a bonus action, you can move the spirit up to 60 feet to a point you can see. The spirit persists for 1 minute or until you’re incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
        HAWK: The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight. When a creature makes an attack roll against a target in the spirit’s aura, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and your allies have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while in the aura.

        - Born on a ship while voyaging on the Gold Sea in midst of travels.

        - At age 8, while voyaging on a merchant ship out of Rium, the ship wrecked, drowning parents and the younger brother.

            Forced back on the sea to fulfill aspects of that observation
        ... Present Day ...

    MOTIVATIONS
        Parental influence:
            - Imprinted with importance of one's family from mother's decision to abandon her home (see TRAITS)
            - Tension in admiring Ul's safety net.
            - Elven outlook helped plant seed (ha) of future druidic leanings
            - Carries a bow due to father

        Early travels:
            - Aquatic aptitude
            - Comfort with open seas
            - Formation of loyalty to those within (see TRAITS)

        Shipwreck: 
            - Left a burning hatred of commerce and the distrust at the motives of trade
            - No fan of merchants, cities
            - Little use for material possessions

        Journey to Vastwood: 
            - Strengthened sense of loyalty to those with and wariness of those outside (see TRAITS)
            - Seeing the victim side of fittest survival ethos, begins formation of a slightly tempered moral compass (see BOND)
            - Reaction to deception was not to gain proficiency and protection, but utter disdain and exclusion of said activities

        Druidic study: 
            - Bit of a pyro;
            - Retrospective thinking about Ul, loathing its xenophobia because its artificial, managed. In other words, unnatural.
            - Combined with Ul ethos, leans quite a bit on the survival of the fittest mindset, but mildly tempered because nature demands a balance and a long term view of a system holistically. Therefore, works against what she interprets as unfair manipulations (see IDEAL)
            - Provide a chance for all to thrive, but let those that fail, fail. No mercy. (see FLAW)
            - Avoids books written on paper (wood pulp); tolerates parchment (skins) (see low INT ability)

        Currently:
            She had her formative upbringing years spent around her mother who would talk positively about Ul. But then, the shipwreck would up-end her world. That, and the subsequent journey to the Vastwood would start making her distrustful of civilizations and people. That would be reinforced as she developed in her druid studies, and no longer having her mother's presence around to temper the learnings, she'd grow more disgusted with man-made stuff. 

            Ul would always stick out in her mind, and be the last place she'd mentally condemn, but it still moves from a place of positive thoughts to sort of a disillusionment. She'd see some positives in them because they live more harmoniously with nature than others. But the borderline xenophobia and breeding would strike her as "artificial, managed. In other words, unnatural."

            Thus, her motivation becomes more like: commerce sucks because it killed my family (shipwreck) and cities suck because they trample nature (druid); Ul is borderline acceptable (mother's influence), but they still need to be opened up - which was my original hook for her motivation.

            She was satisfied in the Vastwood and would've been more or less content to live out the rest of her time there, defending it; but not needing to venture out to pre-emptively do so.

            She wants to put down the druid version of roots there. But then the Enclave comes calling, telling her she has to go; she has to do this task for them. She obviously doesn't want to leave. But they're able to convince her enough (OR, if you think it more interesting, the surving little sister could come into play here) without spilling all the beans, that she needs to go (back to) Rium to keep an eye out for these...specters? I forget the term used.

            Motivation is to make sure the Vastwood stays safe so that she can eventually return. Though, she's obviously aware from her mother's life, that she may have to sacrifice her own preferences in order to do what's needed for her "family".
