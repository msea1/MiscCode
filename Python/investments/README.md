Manual entry of ticker sector and geography is not really sustainable. It's too labor intensive and the weightings update. No good way to pare down into abstract groupings it seems.

For now, actual investments TODO
- find out what's unclassified.
Need more:
-- intl bonds (BNDX, BNDW, BWX, VWOB)
-- us basic materials (VDC, VAW, FMAT, SPDR)
-- us green energy (CNRG, ICLN)
-- us utilities (FUTY, VPU)

## TODO list
- write a parser to take info from usnews and yahoo per ticker
- add 401k tickers
- change balancing to be additive of actual shares rather than constrain 100 budget
- add my current portfolio
- regional weighting goal?
- decision/re-weighting model?
- remove mid cap?
