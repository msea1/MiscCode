Sadly, kindergarten standards are becoming so strenuous that children are only allotted 20 minutes of recess/play time per day resulting in an increase in behavior disruptions, reduced time for fine & gross motor skills, and a general 'sluggish' demeanor in the afternoon. \n\n I want to transform my classroom into safe space where students want to take intellectual risks. \n\n In order to do this I need to find what kind of seating is going to be safe for them to use, is durable, and will allow them to fidget yet stay focused. I've tried some different seating options in the past that lead to children tipping over or becoming too distracted by the apparatus to focus on the work that needed to be done. With 1/3 of my class being on an individualized education plan for different reasons, I need to be extra creative in finding options that will work for all of my students.  \n\n Please help me in my pursuit of finding the perfect flexible seating option for my class. I realize this is a small project and that I'm only asking for one Jellyfish Seat, but I want to make sure it'll work before I ask for a class set.

Students benefit from incorporating lessons and activities that use STEAM: science, technology, engineering, art, and math. Here are some of the specific ways my students can benefit from STEAM in the classroom.  \n\n STEAM projects expose students to the creative process. \n\n When students engage in activities that combine different elements of STEAM, they experience guided inquiry in which they must ask thoughtful questions, discover answers, apply what they learn, and problem-solve creatively. Students learn how to go from a design on paper to a tangible, functional object. \n\n STEAM projects offer meaningful collaboration among the students. Many STEAM projects involve teamwork and thoughtful dialogue in which students exchange ideas and discuss ways to problem-solve. Through these activities, students learn how to divide up responsibilities, compromise, listen to and encourage each other.  \n\n STEAM projects increase critical thinking skills. The projects require students to systematically think through problems, applying the information they learn along the way about technology and engineering to figure out the best solutions.  \n\n All of the materials requested for our STEAM projects stimulate children\u2019s curiosity to explore and learn through play. The LEGO Coding Express materials will be used to begin the teaching and learning of coding concepts. The LEGO Core Set is designed with collaboration in mind: each Core Set supports two students, introducing them to computational thinking and engineering principles in a fun and engaging way. \n\n The Sphero-Robot will allow students to build, drive and code, providing endless opportunities to be creative and have fun while learning. \n\n The Snap Circuits are learning kits that allow students to build electronics projects.

When creating a learning environment, I strive to think outside the box to meet my students\u2019 needs. Many of them come from low socioeconomic backgrounds and cannot provide their own materials. \n\n In order to have a successful learning environment, we first need the tools to create an atmosphere for our students to reach their maximum potential. \n\n A majority of students lack the materials to be successful, but none of them lack the enthusiasm to reach new goals. I hope to provide the instruction and motivation my students need to push through every challenge they face because every student deserves the chance to accomplish their dreams. ", "project desc": "My students need supplemental books to compliment the read alouds we use to teach ELA.  We often learn about unknown topics to them and they become very interested in these new topics. \n\n My students would love the chance to explore new texts about these same topics. \n\n   In my project I have included different sources to support the same ideas we learn about.  In centers I try to find different activities to support the learning we have done in the previous week.  These books would be a great addition to the centers they use.  They would be able to learn even more than they already have.
