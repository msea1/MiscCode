An early reminder that we'd be making use of bidets frequently on this trip. It finally got me over the hump and committed to trying to install one when I got home - which I did ultimately do.

![IMG_7027][a27]

We came to Baku just a week after their F1 race

![IMG_7024][a28]

They built a Vegas-like Venice replica

[a28]: ./photos/IMG_7024.jpg


![IMG_7025][a29]

The carpet museum was built to look like a giant carpet. Pretty neat. Kinda wish we'd visited but didn't end up with the time, energy, nor enough interest to overcome that.

Baku Central Station

![IMG_7119][a32]

Lots of subways/metros in the ex-Soviet world doubled as bomb shelters (c.f Kiev) and so the entries are ridiculously long descents.

They literally sent me this a few days after leaving.

This sidewalk at 2am was quite trippy. There was some sparkling to the paving as well so it sort of shimmered and really messed with your perspective.

Legit decent micro brews; they'll be a rarity

[a39]: ./photos/IMG_7107.jpg


![IMG_7113][a40]

Spotted outside a club at 2am; a completely gold-plated Porsche. Totlally legit I am sure.

The single ATM we could find in the entire airport was this one...
