See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the cleric spell list.</text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Cantrips:</text>				<text>	At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn an additional cleric cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level. </text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Preparing and Casting Spells:</text>				<text>	The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>				<text>	You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>				<text>	For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>				<text>	You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. </text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>				<text>	Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>				<text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>				<text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier </text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Ritual Casting:</text>				<text>	You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. </text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Spellcasting Focus:</text>				<text>	You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</text>				<text>	</text>				<text>Source: Player's Handbook, p. 58</text>			</feature>		</autolevel>

Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels. </text>				<text>	 </text>				<text>Domain Spells:</text>				<text>	Each domain has a list of spells &#8212; its domain spells &#8212; that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</text>				<text>	If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</text>				<text>	</text>				<text>Source: Player's Handbook, p. 58</text>			</feature>		</autolevel>

She forges each group of children into a crop of acolytes with just one purpose: to be judged worthy of a glorious afterlife.

Strength can&#8217;t be taught. It must be built through practice and training. Rhonas demonstrates his teachings by his example, rather than by giving his students any kind of academic instruction.</text>				<text>	He welcomes the people of Naktamun to stand by the Hekma and watch him as he storms into the desert to battle the greatest horrors. He encourages them to observe his indomitable strength, for though they will never equal it, they can aspire to mimicry.

Through insinuation, they remind acolytes and initiates alike that achieving one&#8217;s place in the afterlife at the expense of others is not shameful, but is proof of the initiate&#8217;s determination and drive. Nothing is more important than that drive, they suggest&#8212;not the bonds of a crop, not friendship or love.

<background>	<name>Dissenter Initiate</name>	<proficiency>Athletics, Intimidation</proficiency>	<trait>		<name>Description</name>		<text>Even in the carefully constructed and curated city-state of Naktamun, and in the presence of the five gods, some people rebel against the doctrines of the God-Pharaoh. They don&#8217;t challenge the existence of the gods, of course, for those gods are visible nearly every day in the streets of the city. Nor do they question the fact of life after death, which is plain to see in the anointed mummies that surround them, as well as the marauding mummies outside the Hekma. Rather, these dissenters simply refuse to follow the ordained course of life that leads to the glorious afterlife. </text>		<text>	Some dissenters are spurred by fear, not wanting to subject themselves to a violent death in the trials (or in training for the trials). Some are moved by conscience, unwilling to kill their crop-mates in the trials.

<feat>	<name>Quicksmithing</name>	<prerequisite>Intelligence 13 or higher</prerequisite>	<text>You have mastered the art of on-the-fly invention, improvement, and jury-rigging. You can use your talents to create immediate, short-term magical effects similar to spells, given time and an adequate supply of aether. </text>	<text>	When you choose this feat, you master two magical effects, each of which recreates the effect of a 1st-level spell that has the ritual tag. These spells can come from any class list, but Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for them. </text>	<text>	If you come across a schematic geared toward quicksmithing or study with another quicksmith, you might be able to add another spell to the effects you have mastered. The spell&#8217;s level can be no higher than half your level (rounded up), and it must have the ritual tag. The process of mastering the spell takes 2 hours per level of the spell, and costs 50 gp per level. The cost represents aether you use as you experiment with the spell effect to master it. </text>	<text>	In addition, you have proficiency with artisan&#8217;s tools (quicksmith&#8217;s tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep it functioning. You can use your action to dismantle the device, at which point you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time. </text>	<text>	When you create a device, choose one of the following options: </text>	<text>	 </text>	<text>Clockwork Toy: This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents. </text>	<text>	 </text>	<text>Fire Starter; This device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action. </text>	<text>	 </text>	<text>Music Box: When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song&#8217;s end or when it is closed.</text>	<text> </text>	<text>Source: Plane Shift: Kaladesh, p. 13</text></feat>

You can cast the find familiar spell as a ritual, creating a servo to serve as your familiar instead of an animal. A servo&#8217;s statistics appear in the &#8220;Artifact Creatures&#8221; section of this document. In every other way, a servo familiar functions as described in the find familiar spell. </text>	<text>	You can communicate telepathically with your servo familiar and perceive through its senses as long as you are on the same plane of existence. You can speak through your servo in your own voice. </text>	<text>	Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your servo familiar to make one attack of its own.</text>	<text> </text>	<text>Source: Plane Shift: Kaladesh, p. 13</text></feat>
