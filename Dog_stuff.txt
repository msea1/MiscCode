ACTIONS
	Don't alpha pin
	Stop petting after 5 seconds and gauge dog's reaction. Don't pester him, that's actually a punishment.
	Try using clicker again, think of it like a camera to capture good behavior.
	On squirrel, etc, wait for loose leash, give food at feet, and allow him to explore closer to squirrel.
		Ditto also for dragging toward water
	BAT for social play - 
		Use two leashes clipped
		Beach analogy
	Practice taking his toys away to stop resource guarding
		When chewing the ball, lightly touch, leave a treat, and walk away
		With ball, click when dropped. Grab ball, Treat, Return ball. Eventually name it (drop or give)



BAT - Behavior adjustment training


CC - Counter-conditioning
	Make sure the reward/desensitation occurs AFTER the trigger, not before. Have the dog confront the issue, then reward to show it's no big deal. Use novel rewards reserved ONLY for this case.
